#### Row Number: each row assgin by a different number even there are duplicates

### Rank: It handle duplicate it assign the same number to duplicate but it will jump one digit up when there are duplicate.
like rank: (1,2,3,3,5,6,7,8,9)

### Dence Rank: It handle duplicate it assign the same number to duplicate but it will not jump one digit up when there are duplicate.
like Dence rank: (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)


## Tree:
you are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.



### Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

	Root: If node is root node.
	Leaf: If node is leaf node.
	Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.
	Sample Input

RESULT:
	SELECT 
		N,
		CASE
			WHEN P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
			WHEN N NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT P FROM BST WHERE P IS NOT NULL) THEN 'Leaf'
			ELSE 'Inner'
		END AS NodeType
	FROM BST
